DeepStochLog
=======================================
Welcome to DeepStochLog's documentation.

DeepStochLog is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines grammars, logic, probabilities and neural networks. By writing a DeepStochLog program, one can train a neural network with the given background knowledge. One can express symbolic information about subsymbolic data in DeepStochLog and help train neural networks more efficiently this way.
